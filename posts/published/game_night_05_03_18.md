After a short game of "The Great Dalmuti", in which I was gloriously victorious, the real action began with a game of "Roll for the Galaxy"

Colten, Scott, and I dabbled in shipping. Frank and Eric settled a lot planets and developed lots of tech. Frank ended the game with 12 developments/planets, with very few shipping points distributed. However, the last round no one choose shipping, and Colten was able to develop and  settle for 7 or 8 points, as Frank settled a 1 and 2 point planet to hit the required 12. I'm not sure where my strategy went amiss, I think maybe I miscounted my points. I blame Eric for the massive quantities of delicious food that distracted me. 

Thanks again for hosting Eric!
